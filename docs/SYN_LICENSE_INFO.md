# SYNTASA Licensing Information
SYNTASA relies on a BYOL model which requires a license key to be obtained from SYNTASA ahead of time.

To request a license, please contact the SYNTASA Licensing team at: licensing@syntasa.com

Once requested, SYNTASA representatives will be in touch and will provide users with both a secret key and a license key.
