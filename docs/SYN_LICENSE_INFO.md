# SYNTASA Licensing Information
SYNTASA relies on a BYOL model which requires a license key to be obtained from SYNTASA ahead of time.

To request a license, please submit a request here: http://www.syntasa.com/gcp-marketplace-license-request

Once requested, SYNTASA representatives will be in touch and will provide users with both a LICENSE key and a SECRET key 
to use in the SYNTASA application in either the marketplace or one of the on-prem deployment solutions.
