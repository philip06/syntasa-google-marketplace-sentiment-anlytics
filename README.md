# SYNTASA Customer Intelligence Platform for Google Marketplace
This Repository contains the SYNTASA Google Marketplace deployment scripts using HELM and the GOOGLE development toolkit located here:

[Google Cloud Marketplace](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools)

## Installing the SYNTASA microservice stack

Before Beginning, please obtain a license for SYNTASA, for more information please see:

> [SYNTASA licensing information](/docs/SYN_LICENSE_INFO.md)

Please note that while HELM installations allow the use of RBAC and Service Accounts, the Google Marketplace Installation does not, hence there are two pathways to a successful SYNTASA install.

To install using GOOGLE CLOUD MARKETPLACE, please see: [`MARKETPLACE PRE-SETUP`](/docs/MARKEPLACE_PREREQUISITES.md)
